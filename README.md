This project is a collection of configuration files I use for my favourite softwares.  
The `stow` command is used to manage such configuration files. This command nicely couples with version control systems and facilitates the configuration setup.  
I was incentivated to create this project by reading the *A Thought Experiment* section in *Pragmatic Programmer* by David Thomas and Andrew Hunt: I found insightful the idea of having a mechanism for restoring the state of a machine on another.  
I followed their suggestion by splitting a cup of coffee, not tea, onto my laptop keyboard still getting the desired results.
